          <h2>Worlebury Woods</h2>
          <p>
            Worlebury Woods, also known as Weston Woods can be found on the
            northern end of Weston-super-Mare high on the hillside which
            overlooks Weston and beyond.

            It is a splendid place to visit if you seek tranquil walks amongst
            nature. The dense canopy of trees is perfect for those wishing to
            find a quieter spot away from the hustle and bustle of the town. It
            is favoured locally by dog owners whose canines can enjoy their own
            stick finding adventures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meandering pathways which are well sign posted and accessible for
            wheelchairs, take you on a glorious journey. Depending what time of
            the year you visit, you'll be rewarded by plenty of birdsong, flora
            and fauna to admire.
          </p>
          <p>
            Children are catered for with a wooden play area, including a zip
            wire, which adults can enjoy too! Bring along a pinic to enjoy in
            the designated area.

          <h2>Seafront & Beach</h2>
          <p>
            Known for having one of the highest tidal ranges in the world,
            Weston-super-Mare beach and seafront are popular destinations for
            many. The long, sandy beaches stretch along the Bristol Channel from
            the promenade, where visitors can enjoy views across the water to
            Steep Holm.
          </p>
          <p>
            The beach is host to various events throughout the year, including
            the famous beach race. The Tropicana, found in prime position along
            the seafront was also chosen as Banksy's 'Dismaland'.
          </p>
          <p>
            The beach donkeys are synonymous with Weston-super-Mare and offer
            families an exciting trip out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dogs are also able to enjoy the beach, but restrictions do apply at
            certain times during the year.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is easy access to the high street, which offers places to eat
            and drink, as well as shopping.
